# Hospital-Queue-Management-System
The Hospital Queue Management System is a Java Spring Boot backend application designed to intelligently manage patient flow in a hospital. Instead of using a simple FIFO queue, the system applies data‑structure‑based scheduling logic to ensure that emergency patients are prioritized while also maintaining fairness for long‑waiting patients.
